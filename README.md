I am currently working at ![xm.com](https://cloud.xm-cdn.com/assets/img/common/favicon.ico) as Senior PHP Developer creating PHP packages and webapps using symfony.

Originally I am from Greece (Athens/Aigaleo) but I moved into Cyprus (Limassol) in 2015.

**Tabula rasa**

This is a latin phrase which means "clean slate". In short words noone is born knowning something. We all have seen reactions towards others 

> Wow.. you don't know what facebook is? :scream:

Something that is known for you is unknown for many others. You learn a new thing everyday.
