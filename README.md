### Hello there :wave:

My name is George Mponos. I am currently working at ![xm.com](https://cloud.xm-cdn.com/assets/img/common/favicon.ico) as Senior PHP Developer creating PHP packages and webapps using symfony.

Originally I am from Greece (Athens/Aigaleo) but I moved into Cyprus (Limassol) in 2015.

### Tabula rasa

In short words no one is born knowing everything. Something that is known for you is unknown for many others. You learn a new thing every day.
